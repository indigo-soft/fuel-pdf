PDF package
===========

Fuel wrapper for PHP PDF generator libraries. Default library is TCPDF, which is is one of the best ones. There is also a font converter task included to be able to convert your own TrueType fonts using the TCPDF library's converter.

Other libraries: DomPDF, FPDF, mPDF, WkHTMLtoPDF

This should work with other libraries as well in case the driver is created.
